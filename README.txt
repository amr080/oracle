• PDFs stored as BLOBs
• Metadata stored in separate columns
• Text extracted for indexing via Oracle Text
• Insert/update events logged (user, time)
• Document tools (e.g., WebCenter) track versions
• Detailed user actions in DB logs


• Oracle only “sees” PDFs stored or served through its systems
• PDFs can include hidden elements (like remote images or JavaScript) that ping back to a server
• Such embedded beacons report data (IP, timestamp, etc.) when the PDF loads external content
• Local files remain inaccessible unless deliberately uploaded or synced through Oracle software

• Oracle can store PDFs as binary large objects (BLOBs) in its database
• Oracle WebCenter Content or Oracle Document Cloud can manage, version, and index PDFs
• Text indexing is done by extracting PDF text with built-in filters and storing metadata in tables
• Oracle's indexing service (e.g., Oracle Text) can search across PDF content for queries
• Access control, tracking revisions, and audit trails are managed via Oracle’s content management system
